# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a promotional messages system to display marketing content, announcements, and promotional offers to users in the right column of pages, while removing the existing balance status card to make room for this new functionality. The system will provide a clean, engaging way to communicate with users about promotions, updates, and relevant information.
