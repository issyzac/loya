# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The customer wallet page is displaying "Invalid Date" in some date fields when transaction dates or other date values are null, undefined, or in an invalid format. This creates a poor user experience and makes the interface appear broken. We need to implement robust date formatting that gracefully handles invalid date values and provides consistent, user-friendly date displays throughout the wallet interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer viewing my wallet, I want all date fields to display properly formatted dates or appropriate fallback text, so that I never see "Invalid Date" messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a date value is null or undefined THEN the system SHALL display "N/A" or an appropriate fallback message
2. WHEN a date value is an invalid date string THEN the system SHALL display "N/A" or an appropriate fallback message  
3. WHEN a date value is valid THEN the system SHALL display it in a consistent, localized format
4. WHEN displaying transaction dates THEN the system SHALL show both date and time in separate, clearly formatted fields

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer viewing transaction history, I want consistent date formatting across all transaction entries, so that I can easily understand when each transaction occurred.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying transaction dates THEN the system SHALL use a consistent date format (e.g., "MM/DD/YYYY")
2. WHEN displaying transaction times THEN the system SHALL use a consistent time format (e.g., "HH:MM AM/PM")
3. WHEN a transaction has no date information THEN the system SHALL display "Date unavailable" instead of "Invalid Date"
4. WHEN sorting transactions by date THEN the system SHALL handle invalid dates gracefully without breaking the sort

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer viewing wallet insights, I want all date-related information to be clearly presented, so that I can understand my spending patterns over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying last transaction date THEN the system SHALL show a properly formatted date or "No recent activity"
2. WHEN calculating spending patterns THEN the system SHALL ignore transactions with invalid dates
3. WHEN displaying credit slip ages THEN the system SHALL show "Unknown age" for slips with invalid creation dates
4. WHEN showing activity summaries THEN the system SHALL handle missing date information gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the wallet system, I want a centralized date formatting utility, so that date handling is consistent across all wallet components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting dates throughout the application THEN the system SHALL use a single, reusable date formatting utility
2. WHEN the date utility receives invalid input THEN it SHALL return appropriate fallback values without throwing errors
3. WHEN adding new date displays THEN developers SHALL be able to easily use the centralized utility
4. WHEN date formatting requirements change THEN updates SHALL only need to be made in one location
