# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Pending Bills API Integration feature enhances the existing pending bills functionality by replacing dummy data with real-time data from the backend API. This feature allows customers to view their actual open orders and pending bills by fetching data from the endpoint `{{base_url}}/customers/{{customer_id}}/open-orders`. The integration maintains the existing user interface while providing accurate, up-to-date information about customer orders.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see my actual pending bills loaded from the server, so that I can view accurate information about my open orders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pending bills page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch data from `{{base_url}}/customers/{{customer_id}}/open-orders` endpoint
2. WHEN API request is successful THEN the system SHALL display the fetched pending bills in the existing UI format
3. WHEN API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
4. WHEN no pending bills exist THEN the system SHALL display "You have no pending bills" message
5. WHEN customer ID is not available THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and show appropriate message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see loading indicators while my pending bills are being fetched, so that I know the system is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pending bills page is loading data THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN API request is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous requests
3. WHEN loading is complete THEN the system SHALL hide the loading indicator and show the data
4. WHEN loading takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL maintain the loading state until completion or error
5. WHEN user navigates away during loading THEN the system SHALL cancel the pending request

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the pending bills data to be refreshed when I return to the page, so that I always see the most current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customer navigates to pending bills page THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh data from the API
2. WHEN customer returns to pending bills page from another page THEN the system SHALL reload the data
3. WHEN data is successfully refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the display with new information
4. WHEN refresh fails THEN the system SHALL show the last successfully loaded data with an error indicator
5. WHEN no previous data exists and refresh fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to retry loading my pending bills if the initial request fails, so that temporary network issues don't prevent me from seeing my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API request fails THEN the system SHALL display a retry button or option
2. WHEN customer clicks retry THEN the system SHALL attempt to fetch the data again
3. WHEN retry is successful THEN the system SHALL display the fetched data normally
4. WHEN retry fails THEN the system SHALL show the error state again with retry option
5. WHEN multiple retries fail THEN the system SHALL suggest checking network connection or contacting support

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the pending bills to maintain the same interactive functionality after loading from API, so that I can still view details and pay bills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pending bills are loaded from API THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing UI interactions (expand/collapse, pay button)
2. WHEN customer clicks on a bill THEN the system SHALL expand to show item details as before
3. WHEN customer clicks pay button THEN the system SHALL process the payment using existing functionality
4. WHEN bill is paid THEN the system SHALL remove it from the list and update the display
5. WHEN API data format differs from dummy data THEN the system SHALL handle the transformation seamlessly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for API requests, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API request fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network and server errors
3. WHEN API returns invalid data THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and log the issue
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately and guide user to re-authenticate
5. WHEN API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about service availability
